# Checkpoint custody

Vorton Factory moves unpublished Git state, not worktree directories, credentials, or running agent processes.

This document records the custody behavior inherited by the first FreedOS
activation. In the approved architecture, these claims, epochs, checkpoints,
transfers, and receipts belong to the workspace-scoped Factory module. Freed
task commands below are transitional compatibility operations, not an external
Factory authority to preserve indefinitely.

## Capture

A terminal or interrupted worker candidate is captured from a trusted host journal. The archive binds:

- repository and issue
- claim ID and custody epoch
- source host
- admitted base commit and current repository head
- binary tracked patch
- approved nonignored untracked files
- validation receipts
- creation time

Ignored paths, dependencies, authentication caches, key files, symlinks, absolute paths, and parent escapes are rejected. Pilot limits are 256 MiB per archive and 64 MiB per untracked file.

The complete archive uses XChaCha20-Poly1305. Its manifest is authenticated associated data. Changing the claim, epoch, heads, paths, digest, or receipts makes decryption fail. Storage is content-addressed and verifies bytes on every read.

Candidate finalization, capture, remote storage, and coordinator acknowledgement are separate journal stages. A crash resumes the first missing stage. It never reruns an already completed worker merely because a receipt response was lost.

## Transfer

After 24 hours without a source heartbeat, Vorton Factory may transfer only portable work to a compatible online host.

The coordinator derives the transfer deterministically. It recomputes source
and destination heartbeat freshness, requires the exact current claim, verifies
the checkpoint edge's Ed25519 storage receipt, checks claim, repository, issue,
source host, custody epoch, and time order, advances exactly one epoch, and
emits both the proposed transitional Freed claim-transfer request and
destination restore requirement. This plan carries no authority. During the
compatibility phase, the transfer remains blocked until the supported Freed
command records that exact request. The target Factory module performs the same
transition through Vorton authority.

The transfer sequence is:

1. Re-read the current GitHub lifecycle state and Freed execution claim.
2. Confirm the exact source heartbeat interval and authenticated checkpoint receipt.
3. Fence or supersede the old command.
4. Advance exactly one custody epoch through the supported Freed claim-transfer operation.
5. Create the destination worktree through `scripts/worktree-add.sh` at the authenticated base.
6. Download and decrypt the exact content address.
7. Restore tracked and approved untracked state without overwriting an existing file.
8. Recompute the complete archive from disk and require byte-equivalent identity.
9. Record the destination receipt before resuming execution.

A returning source host with the old epoch cannot resume, release, or publish the transferred claim.

Linux may inherit runtime-neutral work. A macOS-only task remains blocked until a compatible Mac executor is online.

## Storage boundary

The Linux checkpoint edge owns local or S3-compatible storage credentials. An executor receives a five-minute grant bound to one repository, issue, claim, epoch, host, operation, content address, and byte length.

The executor signs the method, path, grant nonce, body digest, and request time with its enrolled host key. The storage edge signs the persisted reference and manifest. The coordinator verifies that receipt against current claim custody before accepting it.

Workers and Codex prompts never receive raw storage credentials or the checkpoint encryption key.

## Key model

The single-factory pilot may provision the same 32-byte checkpoint key as a mode-0600 file to the two equally trusted executors. It is never stored in GitHub, Symphony, Freed task state, the repository, or the archive.

Before enrolling less-trusted hosts, multiple tenants, or external workers, replace the shared pilot key with per-host envelope encryption backed by an external key service.
